# Beat This! Annotations

This repo contains the beat annotations for the ISMIR 2024 paper "[Beat This! Accurate Beat Tracking Without DBN Postprocessing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21658)" by Francesco Foscarin, Jan Schl√ºter and Gerhard Widmer.

The beat tracker that was presented in the paper is publicly available [here](https://github.com/CPJKU/beat_this).

*We are still working to make the annotations for the harmonix dataset available. At this point, the data split is public, but not the beat annotations.*
