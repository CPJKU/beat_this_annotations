# Beat This! Annotations

This repo contains the beat annotations for the ISMIR 2024 paper "[Beat This! Accurate Beat Tracking Without DBN Postprocessing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21658)" by Francesco Foscarin, Jan Schlüter and Gerhard Widmer.

The beat tracker that was presented in the paper is publicly available [here](https://github.com/CPJKU/beat_this).

- [harmonix](https://github.com/urinieto/harmonixset). The dataset was reproduced and partially corrected [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14701). Please cite both the original paper and the modified version.
- [hjdb](https://github.com/superbock/ISMIR2019)
- [jaah](https://github.com/MTG/JAAH). The existing beat annotations were corrected, and downbeat annotations were added by Richard Vogl and Francesco Foscarin.
- [rwc](https://staff.aist.go.jp/m.goto/RWC-MDB/). The RWC pop annotations were partially corrected by Sebastian Böck. *Warning: After publishing the beat_this paper, we noticed that a few annotation files were not properly converted from the original format, and are therefore not correct. We still release the uncorrected annotations for reproducibility, and we will correct them in a future dataset release.*
